# ESP8266-HS-json-dim
a mechanical dimmer, made with ESP8266/Arduino (in my case, an WeMos D1 mini) and a rotary encoder

this will enable you to make a mechanical dimmer that sends the values to Homeseer, or any other home automation software that supports control by JSON-strings.

more info will come later
